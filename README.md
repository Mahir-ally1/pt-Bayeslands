Bayesian inference via Parallel Tempering for  Badlands
=====
 

## Overview

**Ba**sin an**d** **Lan**dscape **D**ynamic**s** (**Badlands**) is a parallel TIN-based landscape evolution model, built to simulate topography development at various space and time scales. The model is capable of simulating hillslope processes (**linear** & **non-linear** diffusion), fluvial incision (*'modified'* **Stream Power Law**, **Transport Capacity Law** both for sediment  erosion/transport/deposition), spatially and temporally varying geodynamic (horizontal + vertical displacements) and climatic forces which can be used to simulate changes in base level, as well as effects of climate changes or sea-level fluctuations. The model uses  [**gFlex**](https://github.com/awickert/gFlex) package which is designed to solve elastic plate flexure for applications to Earth's lithosphere.
