## Overview

We present typical results, for all three problems given in the paper. We note that we only show results that used adaptive random-walk proposals with 10 replicas and maximum of 10 000 samples for each case  shown in exp_results/  folder. 

Within this folder, you can find the Badlands predictions (pred_plots folder) and the posterior for the different parameters (pos_plots folder). 

Details of our experimentation study, using high performance computing using up to 48 cores is shown in bayeslands_runs.xlsx and previous version of results (not in published paper), is shown in bayeslandsRuns_2018results.pdf
